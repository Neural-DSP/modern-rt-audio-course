## Building Projucer

`JUCE` comes as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) of the repository and can be found under the `dependencies` directory.
During the course, we will use [Projucer](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_new_projucer_project.html) as a project management tool, but first you will need to build the application.

The `Projucer` app comes with ready-to-build projects for the main IDEs, which be found under `JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds`. Select and open the appropriate one for your OS/IDE.

### Visual Studio 2019
